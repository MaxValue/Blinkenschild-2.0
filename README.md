# Blinkenschild2

## Development Setup
1. Clone this repo to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/MaxValue/Blinkenschild-2.0.git`
2. Make the utility scripts executable: `chmod +x setup_development.sh run_dev_server.sh`
3. From now on, any time you want to work on this, you can simply run `./run_dev_server.py` . This will start a local development server (you will see all further instructions in the terminal).
